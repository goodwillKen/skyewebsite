This website brief for **Grounded Intimacy** synthesizes the strategic brand architecture, regulatory requirements, and technical specifications detailed in your provided documents.

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

**Grounded Intimacy** is a Victoria-based sole-trader enterprise offering a somatic, non-clinical alternative to traditional therapy. Founded by **Skye**, the business leverages "Experiential Authority" from a 15-year tenure in the Australian sex industry combined with Equine Assisted Learning (EAL). The brand targets individuals and couples seeking "no-nonsense," practical guidance on intimacy, boundaries, and connection.

## **2. Regulatory & Compliance Framework**

The website must serve as a legal firewall to manage Skye's status as a **General Health Service Provider** (non-registered) under Victorian law.

* 
**Mandatory Disclosures:** * **Code of Conduct:** A dedicated page or prominent PDF link to the *Victorian General Code of Conduct*.


* 
**Complaints Pathway:** Explicit text informing clients of their right to contact the Health Complaints Commissioner (HCC), including phone (1300 582 113) and website (hcc.vic.gov.au).


* 
**Insurance Status:** Statement confirming professional indemnity and public liability insurance for both equine and coaching services.




* 
**Linguistic Firewalls:** * **Approved Titles:** "Experiential Intimacy Guide," "Somatic Educator," or "Equine Assisted Learning Practitioner".


* 
**Prohibited Terms:** Avoid "Clinical," "Psychologist," "Treatment," or "Curing" to prevent "holding out" as a registered medical professional.




* **Data Privacy (APP Entity):**
* Since sensitive health and sexual history is collected, the site must be **APP compliant**.


* 
**Technical Requirement:** Integration with a secure Practice Management System (PMS) like Halaxy or PowerDiary for intake forms.


* 
**Consent:** Unchecked "I Consent" boxes for collecting sensitive health data are mandatory.

## **5. E-Commerce Strategy: The Boutique**

To avoid platform restrictions on "Adult Products," the shop is framed as a **Wellness Apothecary**.

* 
**Content:** Product reviews are "Field-Tested" by Skye, focusing on results and mechanics (e.g., "The Workhorse Wand" as the "Landcruiser of vibration").


* 
**Returns Policy:** Must explicitly state that while "Change of Mind" returns are refused for hygiene, **Australian Consumer Law** guarantees for major failures cannot be excluded.



---

## **6. Technical Requirements**

* 
**Audio Engine:** Persistent minimalist footer player for Tina Arena tracks; music should fade/transition upon theme toggle.


* 
**Lyric Watermarks:** Subtle, low-opacity lyrics (e.g., from *Chains*) appearing as background text during scrolling.


* 
**Mobile Responsiveness:** Large, "rugged" buttons suitable for users in rural settings.


* 
**Performance:** Optimization for Victorian rural internet speeds is critical for high-res imagery.
